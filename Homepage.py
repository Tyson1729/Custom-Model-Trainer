    Yo! Welcome to Athena Studio. We're a crew of devs who built this spot just to help you figure out your data without the usual headache. 
    <br><br>
    Tired of wrestling with notebooks just to see what's inside a CSV? We feel you. Our workflow is dead simple:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Uploader:</b> Drop your dataset or grab one of our samples to play around with. No judgment.</li>
        <li><b>Data Visualization:</b> Instantly see what's up with your data. Spot trends, find issues, and clean it up on the fly.</li>
        <li><b>Model Trainer:</b> Don't worry, we got your model training handled. Pick your features, choose a target, and let our custom trainer find the best algorithm for the job.</li>
    </ul>
    Once the training is done, you can predict your outcome, check the scores, and download the best-performing model as a single file, ready to drop into your own project.
    <br><br>
    Ready to build? Hit up the <b>Data Uploader</b> page in the sidebar and let's get this thing started!

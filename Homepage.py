    Hello and welcome! I'm Stryden, your personal AI assistant designed to simplify the machine learning process. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just starting, our studio provides a seamless, intuitive, and powerful platform to transform your raw data into actionable insights.
    <br><br>
    Our workflow is broken down into a few simple steps:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Uploader:</b> Start by uploading your dataset or choose one of our sample datasets to explore.</li>
        <li><b>Data Visualization:</b> Dive deep into your data. Understand its structure, visualize relationships between variables, and clean it up by handling any missing values.</li>
        <li><b>Model Trainer:</b> Select your features and target, choose from a wide range of supervised learning models, and let the studio train them to find the best performer for your specific problem.</li>
    </ul>
    Once the training is complete, you can analyze the performance metrics and download the best-performing model as a file, ready to be deployed in your own applications.
    <br><br>
    Ready to get started? Navigate to the <b>Data Uploader</b> page using the sidebar to begin your journey!
